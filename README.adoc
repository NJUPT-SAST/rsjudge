* Support for multiple compiler versions -- just use your favorite toolchain manager and set the path in config file.
* Supporting both self-testing and final submission.
* Customizable compilation and execution process with TOML config file.
* Monitoring and limiting resource usage.
* Asynchronously report test results.
* Works well with SAST OJ.
* RESTful API and gRPC support, enable or disable them with feature flags and config file.
* Highly extensible with plugins.
* Blazingly fast and secured with RustðŸ¦€.

== Build from source

=== Prerequisites

* Rust 1.74 or later.
* `lld` for faster linking.
** You can use other linkers instead, just update the `.cargo/config.toml` file.
* Linux kernel >= 4.5
** This is required for Seccomp BPF support.
* For gRPC support, the `protoc` Protocol Buffers compiler, along with Protocol Buffers resource files (under `grpc` feature)
* For `.deb` package generation, a Debian/Ubuntu system with `dpkg-dev` and `liblzma-dev` installed.
