An online judge sandbox server in Rust, inspired by https://github.com/criyle/go-judge[go-judge], for SASTOJ.

== Features

* Supports multiple programming languages, with easy way to add new ones in config file.
* Support for multiple compiler versions -- just use your favorite toolchain manager and set the path in config file.
* Supporting both self-testing and final submission.
* Customizable compilation and execution process with TOML config file.
* Monitoring and limiting resource usage.
* Works well with SASTOJ.
* RESTful API and gRPC support, enable or disable them with feature flags and config file.
* Streaming test results in real-time with SSE or gRPC stream.
* Highly extensible with plugins.
* Blazingly fast and secured with RustðŸ¦€.

== Build from source

=== Prerequisites

* Rust 1.74 or later,
* Linux kernel >= 4.5,
** Required for Seccomp BPF support.
* For gRPC support (under `grpc` feature):
** https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf?tab=readme-ov-file#protobuf-compiler-installation[`protoc`] >= 3.15,
** https://github.com/bufbuild/buf/[`buf`] for gRPC dependencies management.
* For `.deb` package generation, a Debian/Ubuntu system with `dpkg-dev` and `liblzma-dev` installed.

=== Install dependencies

You can install Rust toolchain with `rustup`:

[,bash]
----
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
----

==== Debian/Ubuntu

. Install buf manually, if they are not available in the package manager.

. Ensure a `protoc` binary with version >= 3.15 is available in your PATH, or install it manually by downloading from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/[the release page].

** On Debian 12, Ubuntu 23.04 or later versions, you can install a compatible `protoc` with `apt`:
+
[,bash]
----
sudo apt install -y protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev
----

. Install packaging related packages with `apt`:
+
[,bash]
----
sudo apt install dpkg-dev liblzma-dev
----

==== Alpine

[,bash]
----
sudo apk add protoc protobuf-dev

# Installing buf
curl -sSL -o buf \
  "https://github.com/bufbuild/buf/releases/download/latest/buf-Linux-$(uname -m)"
# You can replace `/usr/local/bin` with your preferred directory,
# but remember to add it to `PATH`
sudo install -Dm755 buf /usr/local/bin/buf
----

==== Arch Linux

[,bash]
----
sudo pacman -S --needed protobuf buf
----

=== Build

Clone the repository:

[,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/NJUPT-SAST/rsjudge.git
cd rsjudge
----

Build the project with Cargo:

[,bash]
----
cargo build --release
----

Generate `.deb` package:

[,bash]
----
cargo xtask dist deb
----

The `.deb` package will be generated in `target/debian`.
