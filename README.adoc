:toc: preamble

An online judge sandbox server in Rust, inspired by https://github.com/criyle/go-judge[go-judge], for SAST OJ.

== Features

* Supports multiple programming languages, with easy way to add new ones in config file.
* Support for multiple compiler versions -- just use your favorite toolchain manager and set the path in config file.
* Supporting both self-testing and final submission.
* Customizable compilation and execution process with TOML config file.
* Monitoring and limiting resource usage.
* Works well with SAST OJ.
* RESTful API and gRPC support, enable or disable them with feature flags and config file.
* Streaming test results in real-time with SSE or gRPC stream.
* Highly extensible with plugins.
* Blazingly fast and secured with RustðŸ¦€.

== Build from source

=== Prerequisites

* Rust 1.74 or later,
* `lld` for faster linking,
** You can use other linkers instead, just update the `.cargo/config.toml` file.
* Linux kernel >= 4.5,
** Required for Seccomp BPF support.
* For gRPC support (under `grpc` feature):
** `protoc` as Protocol Buffers compiler,
** `buf` for gRPC dependencies management.
* For `.deb` package generation, a Debian/Ubuntu system with `dpkg-dev` and `liblzma-dev` installed.

=== Install dependencies

==== Debian/Ubuntu

[,bash]
